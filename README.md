<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Darius Richardson</h1>
<h3 align="center">An Aspiring Cybersecurity expert</h3>
<h1>Profile</h1>
<p>A motivated and detail-oriented Computer Science graduate from the University of Lincoln with hands-on experience in robotic process automation. Skilled in using Automation Anywhere and other RPA tools. Proficient in network security and risk analysis, with hands-on experience using tools like Tenable Nessus and OpenCV. Quick to adapt and learn new technologies.</p></p>

<p></p>My passion for cyber security is the importance it plays when dealing with the threats faced every day by bad actors. As technology continues to advance so do cyber-attacks, leading to financial, reputational and disruptive impacts, not just to a business but to everybody, from regular people to big organisations. Having identified a career path within tech, particularly cybersecurity, I recently completed a full-time, government-funded Skills Bootcamp in cybersecurity to help achieve this. I am currently working on personal development projects to continue my advancement as an aspiring cybersecurity expert. I now seek employment opportunities as a Cyber Security Analyst, Cyber Security Engineer, Malware Analyst, or Cyber Defense Incident Responder, ideally in an earn-and-learn capacity, that would allow for ongoing professional development.</p>
