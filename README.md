<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Darius Richardson</h1>
<h3 align="center">An Aspiring Cyber Security Analyst</h3>
<h1>Profile</h1>
I am a motivated and detail-oriented Computer Science graduate from the University of Lincoln with
hands-on experience as a Junior RPA Engineer. Naturally technically minded, I am proficient across many
technologies and systems, with an ability to learn extremely quickly.

Having identified a career path within tech and particularly cybersecurity, I have recently completed a
full-time, government-funded Skills Bootcamp in cybersecurity to help achieve this. I am currently
working on personal development projects to continue my advancement as an aspiring cybersecurity
expert and I now seek employment opportunities, ideally in an earn-and-learn capacity, that would
allow for ongoing professional development.
